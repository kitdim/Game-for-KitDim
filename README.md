<h1 align="center">Hi!</h1>
<br/>
Hello, I have created a game that you can already play.<br/>
I created it using the book "Eric Metiz Learning Python".<br/>
To start, click on the play button.<br/>
Press q to exit.<br/>
Shooting for space.<br/>
Movement is carried out through the left / right keys.<br/>
<br/><br/>
To start the game you need to do the following:<br/>
go install python and the pygame library (google for help);<br/>
run the alien_invasion.py file via the console.<br/>
There are comments in the code. Which will help you figure it out.<br/>
Good game!!!!<br/>
